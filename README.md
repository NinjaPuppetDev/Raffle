## Overview

The **Raffle Project** allows users to enter a lottery where winners are selected at random using Chainlink's verifiable random function (VRF). The process is automated using Chainlink Keepers, ensuring that the lottery runs smoothly without manual intervention. The project includes extensive unit tests to guarantee its reliability and correctness.
